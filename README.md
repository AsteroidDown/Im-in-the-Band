# Im-in-the-Band

This is the repository for my game, I'm in the Band. You can find the game's website (in development) [here](https://asteroiddown.github.io/Im-in-the-Band/)

The game focuses on a group of friends in a band who are playing various gigs to make ends meet. However, a mysterious evil band has been hypnotizing people with their music and getting them to fight off the competetition. This is where you come in. You with the help of your band-mates have to stop this other evil band and play your gigs while you do it!

The reason I wanted to make this game was because I came up with a unique mechanic. Whenever you use an instrument pickup, it will change a part the games soundtrack.
